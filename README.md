![Design preview for the Contact form coding challenge](./src/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/contact-form--G-hYlqKJj) is to build out this contact form and make it look as close to the design as possible. Pay particular attention to making this form accessible. Building accessible forms is a key skill for front-end developers, so this is a perfect challenge to practice.

Your users should be able to: 

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Technologies Used

- Typescript
- React Bootstrap
- React Form Hook
- Accessibility
- Context API
